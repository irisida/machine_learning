    "\n",
    "#### Q: What is Word2vec?\n",
    "A: [Word2vec](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word2vec) is a two-layer neural net processes text. The input is a text corpus and the output is a set of vectors: feature vectors for words in that corpus. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Q: What does it do?\n",
    "A: The usefulness, or purpose of vectors is the vectors of similar words together in vectorspace. This is a process of mathematically detected similarities. The vectors created by `Word2vec` are distributed numerical representations of word features, features such as the context of individual words. This is done without human intervention. Therefore, given enough data, usage and contexts `Word2vec` can make highly accurate guesses about the meaning of a word based on past appearances. The guesses can be used to establish a word association with other words.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Q: How does it work?\n",
    "A: Word2vec trains words against other words that neighbour them in the input corpus. This is done in two possible ways: \n",
    "1. Using context to predict a target word (continuous bag of words)\n",
    "2. Skip-gram, which uses words to predict a context. \n",
    "\n",
    "Basically, inverses of each other. At the end of the process each word is represented by a vector and that in the spacy library each of these vectors has 300 dimensions. "

    "## Cosine similarity\n",
    "\n",
    "The vectorisation process means we can use cosine similarity to measure how similar words are to one another. To get a result this means taken a number of 300-dimensional vectors and making comparisons to derive a similarity. This enables us to perform vector arithmetic with these word vectors. \n",
    "eg: \n",
    "- new_vec = (king - man) + woman\n",
    "- new_vec = giraffe - (tiger + zebra)\n",
    "\n",
    "This creates new vectors not directly associated with a word that allows us to attempt to find the most similar vectors. In the example of `king` this may be queen because of the gender contexts. In the case of `giraffes` this may be something related to skin markings and patterns given all animals have distinguishing markings.    "
