    "An area of computer science and artificial intelligence concerned with the interaction between computers and humans (natural) languages, in particular how to program computers to process and analyze large amounts of natural language data. \n",
    "\n",
    "To add context to the above it is fair to say that when performing analysis, a lot of data is numerical, measurements based and quantifiable. Computers are exceptional at dealing with this type of data. But, textual data is a whole other realm of meaning. Humans can tell there is a plethora of information inside of text documents but a computer needs specialised processing in order to 'understand' raw text data. Text data is highly unstructured and can be a mix of multiple languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "NLP is therefore a variety of techniques to create structure from text data. It is an area of active developments and advances in the field are constant. \n",

    "Typical use cases for NLP: \n",
    "- Email classification between spam and legitimate emails\n",
    "- Sentiment Analysis of movie reviews text\n",
    "- Analyzing trends from written feedback forms\n",
    "- Understanding text commands (Siri, Alexa, Google assistant)"

    "Spacy is an open source NLP library for Python. It is an implementation of common algorithms for effectively and efficiently dealing with language processing problems. For many NLP tasks Spacy only has one implemented method, typically the most efficient algorithm currently available at the time of publishing the library. This means there is often one-way to do things with Spacy. "

This library has a more comprehensive suite of options for achieving particular tasks but that means it also includes options which are not the not efficient implementation, or suboptimal approach to certain problem sets.

    "- For many tasks Spacy is faster and more efficient than NLTK at the cost of having less freedom of choice in algorithmic implementations.\n",
    "- Spacy does not include pre-created models for some applications such as sentiment analysis, which is easier to achieve with NLTK.\n",
