    "\n",
    "Spacy is an open source NLP library for Python. It is an implementation of common algorithms for effectively and efficiently dealing with language processing problems. For many NLP tasks Spacy only has one implemented method, typically the most efficient algorithm currently available at the time of publishing the library. This means there is often one-way to do things with Spacy. "

    "NLTK, or natural language toolkit is another open source option that is hugely popular. This dates back to 2001 where as Spacy was first published in 2015. This library has a more comprehensive suite of options for achieving particular tasks but that means it also includes options which are not the not efficient implementation, or suboptimal approach to certain problem sets.

    "- For many tasks Spacy is faster and more efficient than NLTK at the cost of having less freedom of choice in algorithmic implementations.\n",
    "- Spacy does not include pre-created models for some applications such as sentiment analysis, which is easier to achieve with NLTK.\n",
    "- Approach taken will be to default to Spacy where a use-case exists and fall back to NLTK for problem sets where this library is better or has additional resources and tooling that are not available in Spacy.\n",
