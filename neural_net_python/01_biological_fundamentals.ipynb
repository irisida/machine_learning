    "- Scientific study estimates the amount of neurons in an adult brain to be more than 100 billion. \n",
    "- All these neurons are connected and interconnected. \n",
    "- Information flows between the neurons via these information-link connections which go to explaining human capabilities such as walking, reading, typing, understanding, questioning and so on. \n",
    "- These connections control communications, emotions, creativity etc.. \n",

The `synapse` is the journey from the Dendrites to the point of continued transfer from the Axon via the terminals. After the process of `synapse` biological chemicals enter the Dendrites for the purpose of increasing/decreasing the electrical potential of the cell body.\n",
    "    - The electrical flow in a biological neuron is what gives the potential of the cell which will lead to decision making. \n",
